This repository is a place for me to learn new things and demonstrate my knowledge.

## Server Side

My goal is to build a lot of small services using various techniques: Especially REST, Hypermedia, and GraphQL. Eventually I want to cover the following concepts:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Caching
- Persistence (working with a database)
  - SQL
  - NoSQL, e.g. MongoDB

The services will be small and single-purpose in the style of a microservices architecture.

## Client Side
